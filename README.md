# PAE2.0
Purrfect Apawcalypse Engine 2.0 for 2D games.<br>
> Please please do not use this for fnf i will kill y-

--------------------------------

Why the name?<br>
Cause the engine was originally built to make a fangame for the charming purrfect apawcalypse trillogy, i hope to use it for sepparate projects and thus the distinction.

This engine is based off the [flixel](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel) framework.

# FEATURES

#### DISCLAIMER! This engine has a lot of issues and is constantly being develeoped, there is no stable release for now.


Full game re-coding without recompiling
- Although perhaps not the most performant, with the use of plugins, the main script, custom components, and the level editor, you can re-assmble the game to be completely different without the need to recompile the executable, sadly this means, by deafult, the engine has virtually nothing to offer from the ground up with just the barebones requirements, with most of the gameside source code being boilerplate and templates that need to be implemented sepparately via plugins

Game save states
- it's not perfect, and you'll need to jump through some hoops to get a desired effect but the engine comes with builtin saving/loading functionality, supporting save screenshots and having a custom format.

Fully built in development tools
- The engine comes with all the tools required to produce all the files needed to build a game (.item files, .map files, .save files, etc.) integrated within the executable, you need to be in debug mode and put in the right commands to access them.<br>~in addition, you can also custom code your own development tools, again, without recompiling the EXE.

# FAQ

**Q: Can i recode the engine and/or use it for my own game/application/whatever?**<br>
**A:** Yes! so long as you stick to the license guidelines and you give proper credit, you can use this source code for any kind of project

**Q: Why 2.0? What happened to the older versions of the engine?**<br>
**A:** The older versions of the engine didn't turn out how i wanted, so i scrapped them (i lost count of how many times i've recoded the engine)

**Q: Where is the documentation?**<br>
**A:** There is no documentation at the moment, i'll write some in the future but you have to know the insides of the engine fairly well to do anything right now.
