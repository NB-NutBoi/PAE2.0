Upgraded to newest flixel version

Miscellaneous changes:
 - Added the ability to cache assets if loading from asset file (engine functions do this by default)
 - Re-instated Misc Asset Cache, added basic types plus other helpful types such as graphic or save metadata
 - Changed hScript Timers to have multiple callbacks (to be expanded in the future.)
 - Updated LongTime to have more save-related functions.
 - Added SaveableHaxeScriptBackend as a standard class, for easier implementation.
 - Added TimeScale variable to CoreState
 - Put most trace calls behind #debug compile conditional
 - Tidied up Log File (sepparated sections of the init code.)
 - Improved DialogueState code for game standards.
 - Added a way to override the script a Level loads with
 - Added camera field to Level
 - Updated Vector2D and Array2D for new naming scheme
 - Changed SaveMetadata to be conveniently cacheable.
 - Changed Language File Architecture (now it stores the generated JSON itself.) It should be slightly faster when loading language files.

Utils class update:
 - Added resizeBitmap function
 - Improved performance on deg2Rad and rad2deg
 - Added executeAfterSeconds function
 - Added Timestamp Measuring functions
 - Removed OneOf type (it was useless anyway)
 
Began work on item rework:
 - Not done yet, TBD
 - Items register only once, which allows for item scripts to exist again, instead, Item instances are treated as an ItemStack.
